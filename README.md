# fashionstyle_project
The Problems:

We want to dress nicely and look good, but find it time consuming to put together an outfit, and usually forget about half the items in our closets. We often feel like we have a closet full of clothes but still can’t find anything right to wear for the appropriate occasions- and this causes anxiety. What we need is some kind of an “assistant” to help us select outfits, keep the fashion trend and provide ideas and suggestions for what to purchase or wear that will go well with what we already have.

The Solution:

Our services will be a mobile App that can create outfits for you by analyzing your personal profile (body shape, look, style, likes and dislikes, budget, the clothes you already have…) and matching your profile with clothes offered in the market, while taking into consideration factors like: season, weather, type of occasion. Using AI and Augmented Reality technologies, it will automatically recommend outfits that are appropriate for any event, will flatter your body type, and will be fashionable. Our services provide a service platform can make an impersonal environment seem highly personal. With the tailored services, personalized recommendations, this online fitting services could really help the users to make the right decisions.
